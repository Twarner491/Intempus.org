Unlike current Large Language Models (LLMs) that primarily predict outputs based on input patterns, world models aspire to simulate both causes and effects based on a deeper understanding of time and space.</p> <p>The key to a world model is its ability to grasp cause and effect, which fundamentally requires a temporal understanding. As it turns out, giving a neural network a temporal understanding is quite challenging. While we can instruct an LLM to output current timestamps or locations, it lacks the ability to truly associate actions and experiences within a relative dimension of time and space as humans do.</p> <p>Current approaches to building world models include aim to provide AI systems with a sense of time and space, but they may be missing a crucial element of human temporal understanding:</p> <p>Imagine a humaniod and a human are sitting together at a table. Suddenly, the human stands up, screams, and hurles a chair across the room. The robot, relying solely on visual input, might respond by moving away. In this case:</p> \\[\\begin{align*} x(t) &amp;= \\text{scream, chair thrown} \\\\ a(t) &amp;= \\text{move away} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] <p>\\(x(t)\\) is an observation in a given instant and \\(a(t)\\) is the resulting action in that instant.</p> <p>Now, consider the same scenario, but this time two humans sit together at a table. One human stands, screams, and hurles a chair across the room. The other human\u2019s response is more nuanced, responding first physiologically: they exhibit a change in internal state, then physically: they move backward. In this case:</p> \\[\\begin{align*} x(t) &amp;= \\text{scream, chair thrown} \\\\ a(t) &amp;= \\text{physiological state change} \\\\ a(t+1) &amp;= \\text{move away} \\end{align*}\\] <p>Thus a contemporary humanoid (one constrained to vision alone) goes from A -&gt; C, while a human goes from A -&gt; B -&gt; C.</p>"},{"location":"research/#hypothesis","title":"Hypothesis","text":"<p>World models cannot truly gain a comprehensive temporal understanding based solely on data collected from robots or purely external observations. </p> <p>Temporal understanding cannot be trained from data that goes from A -&gt; C.

These results demonstrate both the promise and limitations of our approach, suggesting that while neural activation patterns contain meaningful information about learning stages, additional architectural innovations may be needed to fully capture the complexity of temporal learning progression in fMRI data.</p>"},{"location":"research/#discussion","title":"Discussion","text":"<p>fMRI data from varaying datasets/test conditions is quite volatile to work with, and reliance on publically avaliable data sources without standerized test conditions certaily dosen\u2019t help. Nonethless the above guessing odds results suggests a correlation worth exploring, suggesting that integrating physiological state data into world model training provides essential insights into biological temporal information processing.</p> <p>Future work should expand beyond fMRI to incorporate the full spectrum of physiological state signals identified in our introduction (facial EMG, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity). This multi-modal physiological state approach, combined with advanced transformer architectures, could enable world models to develop temporal understanding that more closely mirrors human cognitive processes, particularly in causal reasoning and state transitions. </p> <ol> <li> <p>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6904682/\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29587/w29587.pdf\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9824521/\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.28.482337v2.full\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1016823108\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10960227/\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10035\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16139527/\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/2891421\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.nature.com/articles/35107080\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06976\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511895029\u00a0\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"support/","title":"Support","text":"<p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> Intempus <p>Home Research Support</p> dark_mode light_mode <p>   Intempus is equipping agents with an understanding of time and space, so the autonomous machines of the future may \"think\" like a human can.  </p> <p>     We are actively recruiting for our team!  </p> <ul> <li>Hardware Engineering Lead</li> <li>Senior ML Researcher</li> </ul> <p>   If you're interested in working on the future of autonomous machines, contact us at teddy@intempus.org.   </p> <p>   Follow along on our \ud835\udd4f/Twitter @IntempusInc.  </p>"}]}
